🗑️ Delete Operation (CRUD)

This project demonstrates the Delete operation in a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system.

🔹 Description

The delete feature allows removing records from the database using their primary key (ID). This ensures that only the intended record is deleted without affecting other data.

🔹 How It Works

A test record is created in the database.

The delete operation is executed using the record’s primary key.

A query confirms that the record no longer exists.
